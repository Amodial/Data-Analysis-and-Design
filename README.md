In the projects for this course, I worked on implementing various data structures and algorithms to solve specific computational tasks. For instance, one project required creating a priority queue, while another involved building a binary search tree to manage and query data efficiently. My approach began with thoroughly understanding the project requirements and constraints by carefully reading the documentation and identifying the key functionalities. Selecting the right data structures was crucial since it directly impacted the solution's performance and efficiency. For example, I might choose a linked list for frequent insertions and deletions or a binary search tree for efficient searching.

Understanding data structures is essential because they provide efficient ways to store, organize, and manipulate data, significantly affecting an algorithm's performance. During these projects, I encountered several roadblocks, such as debugging complex algorithms or optimizing data structures. To overcome these challenges, I broke the problem into smaller parts, used debugging tools and techniques, and sought help from online forums, documentation, and peers. Discussing the problem with others often provided new insights and solutions.

Working on these projects has significantly expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs. I learned the importance of choosing the right data structures to optimize performance and efficiency and the value of writing clean, modular code that is easy to maintain and extend. My work on these projects has evolved how I write programs, making them more maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I now place greater emphasis on code readability, modularity, testing, and refactoring. Writing clear and concise code with proper comments and documentation, designing programs in a modular way, writing comprehensive test cases, and regularly refactoring code to improve its structure have all become integral parts of my development process. Overall, these projects have not only improved my technical skills but also shaped my approach to problem-solving and software development.
